User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The test suite now assumes the device under test will have a serial console
interface to execute the test cases. A minimal GUI with test execution , reporting
and supporting different interface to execute the testing is planned in upcoming releases.

Failure Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of a test failure,currently the framework only provides a "test failed result"
and to an extent provides what kind of failure like peripheral bus not found , read error
and write errors etc.

It would be a very helpful to the test engineer and the hardware team,if the failure can
pin point the exact issue.If this feature can be added,lot of hardware and software 
design issues can be solved.

New test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following test cases are planned to be added in upcoming versions 

1. SENSORS - Motion sensors,temperature sensors etc
2. DISPLAY - Parallel and serial Displays
3. TOUCHSCREEN - Touchscreen calibrations
4. WI-FI - accesspoint connection,basic communication
5. BLUETOOTH - profiles test, basic data transfer
6. ADC - calibration test
7. WATCHDOG - timeouts test
8. NAND FLASH - read/write test, ECC test
